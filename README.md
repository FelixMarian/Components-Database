# Components Database

## Description

**Components Database** is a desktop application developed with PyQt5, designed for efficiently managing an electronic components collection by storing data in an SQLite database. It offers a user-friendly graphical interface with functionalities for adding, editing, deleting, and searching for components in the database. I developed it for personal use.

## Features

- `Add a Component`: You can add a new component, specifying its type, model, code, quantity, and attaching a datasheet.
- `Delete a Component`: Completely remove a component from the database.
- `Update a Component`: Modify the quantity of an existing component, with the option to either increase or decrease the amount.
- `Search for a Component`: Search for components by type, model, and code. The current quantity and datasheet will be displayed.
- `View All Components`: You can see a table (TreeView) listing all components in the database.

## Libraries Used

- PyQt5
- PyQt5-tools
- SQLite3

## How to Use the Application

1. Clone the repository to your desired folder:  
   `git clone https://github.com/FelixMarian/Components-Database`
